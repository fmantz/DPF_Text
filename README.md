DPF Text is a textual graph-based modeling framework. 
It has been a side product on my research on modeling and algebraic graph transformations at Bergen University Collegue/Philipps University of Marburg.
Now, I want to share it and contribute it to the community. You are welcome to fork me!

```
$ cd your_repo_root/
$ git clone https://github.com/fmantz/DPF_Text.git
```
